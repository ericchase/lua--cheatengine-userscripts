# lua scripts
Lua scripts made by myself for Cheat Engine.

### usage: windows
Copy the files within the `My Cheat Tables` directory in this repository to your `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Cheat Tables` directory.  
- Replace `<username>` with your actual Window's user name.
Copy the `__init.lua` file to the `autorun` directory within the Cheat Engine installation directory on your machine.
On startup, Cheat Engine will automatically run the `__init.lua` script, which will then load the other scripts.

### please
Use these scripts and feel free to share them.<br/>
If improvements can be made, submit an issue!<br/>
Thanks<br/>
